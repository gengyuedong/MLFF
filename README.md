# MLFF
MLFF
•	Trained a Machine Learning Force Field (MLFF) model to predict defect structures in Antimony Sulfide (Sb2S3), enhancing understanding of semiconductor properties for solar cell applications
•	Fine-tuned ML models for vacancy defects and extended applications to interstitial and antisite defects, using Python and TensorFlow on HPC GPU resources
•	Evaluated model performance using DFT calculations and the cosine distance of SOAP vectors, achieving accurate predictions for antisite defects
